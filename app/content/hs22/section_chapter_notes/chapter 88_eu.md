They may be designed to carry a payload or equipped with permanently integrated digital cameras or other equipment which would enable them to perform utilitarian functions during their flight. 

    The expression “unmanned aircraft”, however, does not cover flying toys, designed solely for amusement purposes (heading 9503).
