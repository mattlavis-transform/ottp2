In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

(a) Bars and rods:

Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including 'flattened circles' and 'modified rectangles', of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length.

The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including 'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

(b) Profiles:

Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

(c) Wire:

Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including 'flattened circles' and 'modified rectangles', of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. 

The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including 'modified rectangular') cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width.

(d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil:

Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading 7601), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded corners (including 'modified rectangles' of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are:

- of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width,

- of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

Headings 7606 and 7607 apply inter alia to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

(e) Tubes and pipes:

Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross-section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross-sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.

### Subheading notes

1. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

    a. Aluminium, not alloyed:
    
    Metal containing by weight at least 99% of aluminium, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table:
    
    **Other elements
    
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <p><strong>Element</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p><strong>Limiting content % by weight</strong></p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <p>Fe + Si (iron plus silicon)</p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p>1</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <p>Other elements each</p>
    <p>(Other elements are, for example, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn.)</p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p>0.1</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(Copper is permitted in a proportion greater than 0.1 % but not more than 0.2 %, provided that neither the chromium nor manganese content exceeds 0.05%)</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    b. Aluminium alloys:
    
    Metallic substances in which aluminium predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:
    
    (1) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements or of iron plus silicon taken together is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table, or
    
    (2) the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 1%.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter note 1(c), for the purposes of subheading 7616 91 the term 'wire' applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.

### Additional chapter notes

1. For the purposes of subheading 7601 20 20, the following terms shall have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

    - ‘slabs’: unwrought products which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of a rectangle or other polygon, of a width exceeding 800 mm, of a thickness exceeding 280 mm and of a length always superior to the width and to the thickness. These products are intended for being rolled;
    
    - ‘billets’: unwrought products which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of a circle (including a ‘flattened circle’), of a diameter exceeding 125 mm. These products are intended for being extruded.

2. For the purposes of subheadings 7606 12 11 and 7606 12 19, the following terms shall have the meaning hereby assigned to them:
    
    - ‘beverage can body stock’: sheets or strips in coils, rolled, having manganese as the predominant alloy element and having a minimum tensile strength of 262 MPa. The sheets or strips have a uniform solid cross section along their whole length, are of a width of 300 mm or more but not more than 2000 mm, of a thickness exceeding 0.2 mm but not exceeding 0.4 mm, and of a length always superior to the width and to the thickness. Beverage can body stock is pre lubricated, with a bright surface;
    
    - ‘beverage can end stock and tab stock’: sheets or strips in coils, having magnesium as the predominant alloy element and having a minimum tensile strength of 345 MPa. The sheets or strips have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length, are of a width of 30 mm or more but not more than 2000 mm, of a thickness exceeding 0.2 mm but not exceeding 0.35 mm, and of a length always superior to the width and to the thickness. Beverage can end stock is varnished on both sides. Beverage can tab stock is degreased and oiled.
    
    These products are to be used for the fabrication of rigid beverage cans, including ends (lids) and tabs.
