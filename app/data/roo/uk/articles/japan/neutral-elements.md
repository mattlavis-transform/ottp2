- **neutral elements**, meaning equipment and materials used in the production, but not physically incorporated into the final product, such as fuel, tools or machinery,
- **packing materials and containers** for shipment used during transportation,
- **packaging materials used for retail sale** when classified with the product
- **accessories, spare parts, tools and information materials** if they are invoiced and delivered with your product.

### Neutral elements

In order to determine whether a product is originating in a Party, it shall not be necessary to determine the originating status of the following elements:

(a) fuel, energy, catalysts and solvents;

(b) equipment, devices and supplies used to test or inspect the product;

(c) gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies;

(d) machines, tools, dies and moulds;

(e) spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings;

(f) lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; and

Article 14
Packing materials and containers for shipment

Packing materials and containers for shipment that are used to protect a product during transportation shall be disregarded in determining the originating status of a product.


Article 15
Packaging materials and containers for retail sale

1. Packaging materials and containers in which a product is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the product, shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the product have undergone the applicable change in tariff classification or a production process set out in Annex B or whether the product is wholly obtained.

2. If a product is subject to a value requirement set out in Annex B, the value of the packaging materials and containers in which the product is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the product, shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating, as the case may be, in the calculation for the purpose of the application of the value requirement to the product.
