### Sufficiently worked or processed products

1.	For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Appendix II are fulfilled. 
 
The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Chile Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. 
 
Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in Appendix II is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the resulting product do not apply to the incorporated product, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture. 
 
2.	Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the products which are not wholly obtained and listed in Appendix II (a) are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Appendix II (a) are fulfilled. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply for three years following the entry into force of the United Kingdom-Chile Agreement. 
 
3.	Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in Appendix II or Appendix II(a), should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that: 
 
a.	 their total value does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the product; 

b.	any of the percentages given in Appendix II or in Appendix II(a) for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph. 
 
Without prejudice to notes 5 and 6 of Appendix I, this paragraph shall not apply to products falling within chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2002. 
 
4.	Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply except as provided in Article 6.
